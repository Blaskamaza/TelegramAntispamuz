# 📢 Marketing Strategy: Hamxona (Tashkent Flatmate Finder)

## 🎯 Target Audience
Gen Z and Millennials (18-30 years old) in Tashkent. Segments: 1) Students from regions (Viloyat) moving to the capital for university. 2) Young professionals wanting to move out of parents' houses but sensitive to rent prices. 3) 'Relocants' looking for Russian-speaking flatmates. They hate 'Maklers' (realtors) and high commissions.

## 💎 UVP
Hamxona is the 'Tinder for Roommates' in Tashkent. No greedy realtors (Maklers), no 50% commission fees, just direct peer-to-peer connections via a fast Telegram Bot. Find a flatmate who matches your vibe, not just your budget.

## 🚀 Launch Strategy
The 'VIP Access' Loop: Users can search for 3 roommates for free. To unlock unlimited swipes or see contact details immediately, they must share their personal referral link to 3 friends or 1 group chat. This forces distribution into private networks.

🚩 **5 Red Flags When Choosing a Roommate in Tashkent**

Before you say 'Yes' and move your mattress in, check these vibes. We asked 500 students, and here is what they hate most:

1️⃣ **The 'Ghost' Payer:** Says 'I'll pay rent on Monday' every single month. (Bro, the landlord is waiting outside).
2️⃣ **The Plov Thief:** Eats your food but never buys groceries. 'I thought it was communal!' 🥘
3️⃣ **The 24/7 Guest:** Their boyfriend/girlfriend practically lives there but pays $0 rent.
4️⃣ **The AC dictator:** Keeps the AC on 18°C when it's freezing, or turns it off when it's +40°C outside to 'save money.'
5️⃣ **No Boundaries:** Uses your towel. Just... don't.

🛡️ **Protect yourself:** Use the **Hamxona Bot** to view verified profiles and habits before you meet.
