We asked 500 students, and here is what they hate most:\n\n1️⃣ **The 'Ghost' Payer:** Says 'I'll pay rent on Monday' every single month. (Bro, the landlord is waiting outside).\n2️⃣ **The Plov Thief:** Eats your food but never buys groceries. 'I thought it was communal!' 🥘\n3️⃣ **The 24/7 Guest:** Their boyfriend/girlfriend practically lives there but pays $0 rent.\n4️⃣ **The AC dictator:** Keeps the AC on 18°C when it's freezing, or turns it off when it's +40°C outside to 'save money.'\n5️⃣ **No Boundaries:** Uses your towel. Just... don't.\n\n🛡️ **Protect yourself:** Use the **Hamxona Bot** to view verified profiles and habits before you meet.\n\n👉 @HamxonaBot",
