# 📢 Marketing Strategy: TashkentPlumbFix

## 🎯 Target Audience
{'primary': "The 'Novostroyka' Owner (Tashkent)", 'demographics': '25-40 years old, lives in Yunusabad/Chilanzar/Mirabad, uses Payme/Click daily.', 'psychographics': "Values time over money. Fears 'remont' (renovation) disasters. Hates negotiating prices at the bazaar. Trusts Telegram over Google.", 'secondary': "The 'Digital Usta' (Master)", 'master_profile': 'Skilled plumber tired of standing at Kuyluk bazaar waiting for work. Wants a steady stream of orders via phone.'}

## 💎 UVP
TashkentPlumbFix: The 'Uber for Plumbers' inside your Telegram. No apps to download, no random prices. Verified masters in 3 clicks.

## 🚀 Launch Strategy
{'loop_1': "The 'Mahalla Shield': Invite 3 neighbors to the bot, get 'Priority Status' (Master arrives in <30 mins). Logic: If your neighbor's pipe bursts, YOU get flooded too. It's in your interest to have them on the app.", 'loop_2': "Master Verification Badge: Masters get a generated 'ID Card' image to share on their status/stories, driving traffic back to the bot."}

🧠 **Lifehack: What to do while waiting for the Usta?**

Don't just stand there with a bucket! If you have a leak, every second counts. Here is the TashkentPlumbFix protocol:

1️⃣ **Shut the Main Valve:** Usually located behind the toilet or under the sink. Turn it clockwise until it stops.
2️⃣ **Open the Faucets:** Drain the remaining water in the pipes to relieve pressure.
3️⃣ **Take a Photo:** Upload it to our Mini App. This helps the master bring the exact right parts (no more "I need to go buy a part" delays).

💡 *Did you know?* 40% of flood damage happens because people can't find the main valve. Go check yours right now!

**Need a pro? Tap the button below.**

**🎨 Image Prompt:** `A minimalist, flat-design infographic in blue and white tones. Step 1: Hand turning a valve. Step 2: Water draining from a tap. Step 3: Smartphone taking a photo of a pipe. Text labels in Russian/Uzbek style font.`
