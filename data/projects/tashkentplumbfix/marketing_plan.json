Here is the TashkentPlumbFix protocol:\n\n1️⃣ **Shut the Main Valve:** Usually located behind the toilet or under the sink. Turn it clockwise until it stops.\n2️⃣ **Open the Faucets:** Drain the remaining water in the pipes to relieve pressure.\n3️⃣ **Take a Photo:** Upload it to our Mini App. This helps the master bring the exact right parts (no more \"I need to go buy a part\" delays).\n\n💡 *Did you know?* 40% of flood damage happens because people can't find the main valve. Go check yours right now!\n\n**Need a pro? Tap the button below.**",
